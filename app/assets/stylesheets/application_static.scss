 * *****************  WHAT IS THIS FILE?  ***************************************************************************************
 *
 * `app/assets/application_static.scss`
 *
 * COMPARE TO: app/assets/application_non_webpack.scss:
 * - `application_static.scss` (this file) loads **Webpacked CSS**, but in a static manner:
 *    (i.e.: it's your component modular CSS styles, but only when you're not hot reloading.)
 *    (Hot reloading will load them in for you, so you don't need `application-static.scss`.)
 * - `application_non_webpack` is the 'standard' application.scss - for all app-wide styles, nested stylesheets, and imports.
 *
